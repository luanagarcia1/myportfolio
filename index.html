        <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
        <p>I'm delighted to welcome you to my digital realm! 
            As a former flight attendant, I soared through the skies, ensuring the safety and comfort of passengers. Today, I've touched down in the dynamic world of web development, and I'm ready to embark on a new kind of journey with you. 
            Based in sunny Los Angeles, California, I draw inspiration from the vibrant tech community and the picturesque landscapes that surround me. My passion for creating captivating web experiences led me to graduate from the Thinkful Boot Camp.
            Join me as we navigate this exciting path in the ever-evolving world of technology and design.
